# Chronos Project
Chronos is a clean, minimal to-do list app that helps students and teams stay organized and productive. Schedule tasks, set reminders, and add notes. With support for collaboration, recurring tasks, and smart progress tracking, Chronos turns plans into action—on time, every time.

#### The project is still ongoing, documentation will be added once it is finished.
